This project tranforms Reef Visual Census data for the Florida Keys for use in assessment of bottom cover maps.

`.csv` files produced from this code can be uploaded into Google Earth Engine as a table asset.
Tables can then be used as a FeatureCollection, filtered, and displayed:

```javascript
var fc = ee.FeatureCollection("projects/imars-ee/assets/RVC_DryTortugas")
  .filterDate("2023-01-01", "2024-07-01")
  .filter(ee.Filter.eq("HABITAT_CD", "CONT_LR"))
;
  
Map.addLayer(fc)
Map.centerObject(fc)
```
